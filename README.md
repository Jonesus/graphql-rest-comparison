# GraphQL vs REST comparison benchmarks

package.json has available scripts

use `npm run graphql-dev` for automatic server restart on save.

## TODO

- REST API post requests, more complicated get requests
- Add GraphQL mutations
- Join tables in GraphQL, e.x fetch Posts with author information
- Add benchmarking, time to get response and response size
